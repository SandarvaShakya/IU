              Lee Ji-eun (Korean: 이지은; born May 16, 1993), known
              professionally as IU (Korean: 아이유), is a South Korean
              singer-songwriter and actress. She signed with Kakao M (formerly
              LOEN Entertainment) in 2007 as a trainee and debuted as a singer
              at the age of fifteen with her album Lost and Found. Although her
              follow-up albums, Growing Up and IU...IM, brought mainstream
              success, it was after the release of "Good Day" (Korean: 좋은 날),
              the lead single from her 2010 album Real, that she achieved
              national stardom. "Good Day" went on to spend five consecutive
              weeks at the top position of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, and
              in 2019 it was ranked number one on Billboard magazine's 100
              Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s.
            </p>
            <p class="section__text section__text--push">
              With the success of her 2011 albums, Real+ and Last Fantasy, IU
              established herself as a formidable force on the music charts of
              her native country and further cemented her girl next door image
              as Korea's "little sister". 2011 also saw her first foray into
              songwriting with "Hold My Hand", which was written for the
              television series The Greatest Love. IU's third full-length album
              release, Modern Times (2013), showcased a more mature style that
              marked a departure from her earlier girlish image, with several
              tracks reaching the top 10 positions on Gaon Digital Chart. While
              her subsequent releases, including albums A Flower Bookmark,
              Chat-Shire, and Palette, continued to deviate from the mainstream
              K-pop style, IU retained her dominance on music charts. Chat-Shire
              marked the first time she is credited as the sole lyricist and
              composer of her own album. IU has released a total of four studio
              albums and nine extended plays in her career, scoring three
              number-one albums and twenty-four number-one singles on the Gaon
              Music Charts.
